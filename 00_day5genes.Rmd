## Pulling genes from cluster analyses

### mbcluster.seq

Given the `mbcluster.seq` checkboard results (below) and remembering that the coded stages are: **a** = L3, **b** = 24hrPI, **c** = 5dayPI, **d** = 10dayPI, **e** = AdMal, **f** = AdFem, **g** = micfil:


```{r fig1,fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap = "Checkboard, MBCluster.seq output"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/TimeCourse_plot_25Clusters_VeryGoodP0.90.png")
```

I would say that the genes enriched at day5 are represented by clusters: 1, 8, 13 and 20. The gene ids corresponsing to each cluster are in a folder:

[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ziN3GQe7bar3l4KgNI5yajSSnXylj4sZ) and they are csv files that you can download and open in Excel or a plain text editor such as TextEdit or NotePad. 

### Kohonen

Given the `kohonen` results shown below:

```{r fig2, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap = "Kohonen output"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Kohonen_40cluster.png")
```

And knowing that the cluster numbering starts from bottom left:

```
  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
  
 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 
  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
  
 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 
  01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 
```

I would say that the interesting clusters, for those genes with higest expression at day5 are clusters: 1, 25, 33 and 40.

I've made files with the list of genes for each of the clusters of interest here: (same link as before)
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y9OtPkQIRrvEr9jmsbs2Y1moqYtgF9JP) and they are csv files that you can download and open in Excel or a plain text editor such as TextEdit or NotePad. 

However, if you'd like to see lists of genes of other clusters, see this [excel file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Oo1Uc-Qer17pibVQ6TpZ-cNDGOsoRStN)
