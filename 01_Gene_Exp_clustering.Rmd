## Pulling genes from cluster analyses

### mbcluster.seq

Given the `mbcluster.seq` checkboard results (below) and remembering that the coded stages are: **a** = L3, **b** = 24hrPI, **c** = 5dayPI, **d** = 10dayPI, **e** = AdMal, **f** = AdFem, **g** = micfil:


```{r fig1,fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap = "Checkboard, MBCluster.seq output"}
knitr::include_graphics("output/figures/TimeCourse_plot_25Clusters_VeryGoodP0.90.png")
```

I would say that the genes enriched at day5 are represented by clusters: 1, 8, 13 and 20. The gene ids corresponsing to each cluster are in a folder:

[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15GEtlm8pirQh6zbUOlgqu8b2MUw3gYqa?usp=sharing) and they are **Excel** files that you can download. Individual clusters are in each sheet inside the workbook. 

### Kohonen

Given the `kohonen` results shown below:

```{r fig2, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, fig.cap = "Kohonen output"}
knitr::include_graphics("output/figures/Kohonen_40cluster.png")
```

And knowing that the cluster numbering starts from bottom left:

```
  01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 

 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
  
 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 
  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
  
```
You can use the same link above as access the results.

I am not sure about the Kohonen results, they are not really following what I was expecting in terms of showing, at least in some degree, some concordance with MBCluster.Seq results.
